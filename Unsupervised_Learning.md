# Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

## Mixture Model

$p(x) = \sum_z p(x, z) = \sum_z p(x|z)p(z)$

where x denoting a feature variable, z denoting the class label variable.

## Gaussian MM

$p(x) = \sum_{k=1}^K \ \pi_k N(x|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)$ with $\pi_k$ mixing coefficients, where $\sum^K \pi_k = 1$ and $\pi_k \geq 0, \ \forall k$
